"""
A file containing all the labels assigned to all operations inside the extension.
Note that the labels are divided by class and file, as to find them easily.

The labels are used around the other folders to avoid spreading "magic strings" and
to prevent dead-link operators which Blender cannot render and have no effect.

When a class requires to draw the corresponding property operator, it can access the
label as Labels.NAME.value

Operation labels which are terminated with _ are internal operations which are more likely
related to auxiliary GUI (e.g. menu drawing, etc...) although the distinction is
admittedly somewhat fuzzy
